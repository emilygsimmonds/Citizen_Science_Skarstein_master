# Citizen_Science_Skarstein_master
All code and associated files for the master thesis of Emma Skarstein. 

Following the structure suggested by the British Ecological Society we have the following folders:

- data: contains all input data
- figs: contains figures generated by the analysis
- output: contains any type of intermediate or output files (e.g. simulation outputs, models, processed datasets, etc.). Might separate this and also have a cleaned-data folder.
- R: contains R scripts with function definitions
- reports: contains RMarkdown files that document the anaysis or report on results.
- The scripts that actually do things are stores in the root directory.
